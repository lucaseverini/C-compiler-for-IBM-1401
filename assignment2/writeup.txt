Write up for the Retros

Assumptions made:
	- Misunderstanding the spec so we wrote our own java tokenizer
	- No invalid tokens

We misunderstood the specs and we wrote our own java tokenizer.  Everything was going well until I reread the spec sheet and realized we were supposed to modify your existing code.  As such our program tokenizes java very well and pascal not so well.  One issue we ran into while trying to change our code to work with your code is that the syntax was entirely different.  We could not change our code to fit yours.  So we tried to add to your code but that was taking too long to complete and we would not have had a working program.  So we did the only option left, change our code to parse pascal tokens.  We will need to do more work reading the spec sheet for homework3. Also we will have to redo homework 2 in your framework so that we can do homework3.
